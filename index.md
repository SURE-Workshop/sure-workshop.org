description: The Workshop on Software Understanding and Reverse Engineering
---
Software, in all its complexity, is more abundant today than ever. 
Regardless of the form (binary, source, diagrams, etc.), understanding modern software requires significant effort.
As such, modern researchers have worked, often across domains, to develop tools and techniques to close the [understanding gap](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/16/2003629074/-1/-1/0/Joint-Guide-Closing-the-Software-Understanding-Gap.PDF). 
The Workshop on **Software Understanding and Reverse Engineering** (SURE) aims to gather research in this area and engage the community to understand its limitations. 

We are proud to announce that the 1st SURE Workshop will be co-located at [ACM CCS 2025](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/) in Taiwan.
We are seeking new research in software understanding and reverse engineering as described in our [Call for Papers](./cfp.md).

To further engage the community, we have also opened a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eVySXH7ZQ8) in cooperation with the [Decompilation Wiki](https://decompilation.wiki/).
We encourage both researchers and practitioners to join the server to discuss topics relevant to SURE. 
Follow us [on X](https://x.com/sureworkshop) for updates and announcements. 

**Our submission site for SURE 2025 is now open**: [sure25.hotcrp.com](https://sure25.hotcrp.com/).
